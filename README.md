# Harry Potter WebApp
## Hi!
Harry Potter universe's is amazing right? So why not to bring them to the internet and make my own web application page about Hogwarts with its particular characters?
That's exactly what I did!

With this little web application you can see a little more characteristics about your favourite characters and its respective houses as well.
Up next you can find what's in this web app and how it works.

## Homepage
At the homepage you will be presented with 4 different links that will take you to...

- ### All Hogwarts Characters
  In this page you will see a long card-list with all Hogwarts characters each card will have a link that will take you to the page of that character you clicked on.
  
- ### Hogwarts Students
  In this page you can choose from which Hogwarts house you want to see the student list it could be either Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Slytherin and Ravenclaw.
  Each card will take to the student page that you clicked on (just like the 'All Hogwarts Characters' page).
  
- ### Hogwarts Staff
  At this page you will only find a card-list with the Hogwarts staff. In this page, each card is going to take you to the staff character that you clicked on 
  (as the 'All Hogwarts Characters' page and the 'Hogwarts Students' page).
  
- ### Houses
  In this page you could see some info about the houses that conform Hogwarts itself like its values, its founder and its ghost :ghost:
  
## That's it!

Thank you for visiting Harry Potter's API. Hope you like it :)
